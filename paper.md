# Summary

Lipid Domain Transport Analyzer is a comprehensive Python toolkit for analyzing how specific membrane lipids (e.g., GM3 gangliosides, cholesterol, sphingomyelin) affect protein localization between cholesterol-rich and disordered membrane domains in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The software employs Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to automatically identify protein states from noisy trajectory data, distinguishing between lipid-bound and unbound states across different membrane domains. It then applies hierarchical Bayesian statistics to rigorously quantify transport effects with uncertainty estimates, enabling researchers to determine whether observed effects are statistically significant or merely random fluctuations.

# Statement of need

Membrane lipid composition plays a crucial role in regulating protein function and cellular signaling. Understanding how specific lipids facilitate protein transport between different membrane domains is essential for advancing our knowledge of membrane biology and developing therapeutic strategies. While many computational tools exist for analyzing MD trajectories, there is a lack of specialized software for quantifying lipid-mediated protein transport effects with proper statistical rigor.

Current approaches often rely on simple distance-based metrics or manual analysis, which fail to capture the complex dynamics of membrane domain organization and protein-lipid interactions. This software addresses these limitations by providing:

1. **Automated detection** of all lipid types and proteins from MD trajectory files
2. **Configurable target lipid analysis** supporting any membrane component
3. **Four-state Hidden Markov Model** classification combining lipid binding and domain localization
4. **Hierarchical Bayesian statistics** for quantifying transport effects with uncertainty
5. **Publication-ready visualizations** with statistical annotations

The toolkit is particularly valuable for researchers studying ganglioside-mediated transport, cholesterol effects on membrane organization, and lipid raft dynamics.

# Features

## Core Functionality

- **Automatic system detection**: Dynamically identifies all lipid types and proteins from PSF/XTC trajectory files
- **Configurable target lipid**: Supports analysis of any membrane lipid (GM3, cholesterol, sphingomyelin, etc.)
- **Four-state classification**: Non_TARGET_D, Non_TARGET_CS, TARGET_D, TARGET_CS states
- **Hidden Markov Model analysis**: State determination and transition probability matrices
- **Bayesian statistics**: Hierarchical modeling of group-level effects with uncertainty quantification
- **Parallel processing**: Multi-core support for large trajectory analysis

## Statistical Methods

### Hidden Markov Models: Finding Hidden States in Noisy Data

Molecular dynamics trajectories are inherently noisy - proteins constantly fluctuate, and lipid interactions are transient. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) solve this challenge by identifying underlying "hidden" states that persist despite surface-level noise. 

In our implementation, HMMs automatically classify each trajectory frame into one of four biologically meaningful states:
- **State 0 (Non_TARGET_D)**: Protein without target lipid in disordered membrane regions
- **State 1 (Non_TARGET_CS)**: Protein without target lipid in cholesterol-rich domains  
- **State 2 (TARGET_D)**: Target lipid-bound protein in disordered regions
- **State 3 (TARGET_CS)**: Target lipid-bound protein in cholesterol-rich domains

The key insight is that HMMs can detect when a protein has truly changed states versus when it's just experiencing random fluctuations. For example, a protein might briefly lose contact with a GM3 lipid due to thermal motion, but the HMM recognizes this as noise rather than a true unbinding event.

### Transition Probability Analysis: Quantifying Transport Effects

Once states are identified, the software calculates a 4×4 transition probability matrix showing how likely proteins are to move between states. The transport effect is quantified by comparing specific transitions:

**Transport Effect = P(TARGET_D → TARGET_CS) - P(Non_TARGET_D → Non_TARGET_CS)**

This tells us: Does binding to the target lipid increase the probability of moving to cholesterol-rich domains? A positive value indicates the lipid enhances transport, while a value near zero suggests no effect.

### Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis: From Individual Proteins to Population Effects

Traditional statistical methods might average results across proteins, losing important information about variability. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling solves this by simultaneously modeling:

1. **Individual protein effects**: Each protein's unique transport behavior
2. **Population-level effects**: The overall trend across all proteins
3. **Uncertainty at both levels**: Confidence intervals for individual and group effects

This approach answers critical questions:
- Is the observed transport effect real or due to random chance?
- How consistent is the effect across different proteins?
- What is the likely range of the true effect size?

The Bayesian framework provides "credible intervals" (similar to confidence intervals) that directly tell us the probability that the true effect lies within a certain range. For instance, if the 95% credible interval for transport effect is [0.15, 0.25], we can be 95% confident that the target lipid increases transport probability by 15-25%.

## Output and Visualization

The analysis generates three integrated publication-ready figures that together tell the complete story of lipid-mediated transport:

(A) State distribution plot reveals the time each protein spends in different membrane states, with percentage labels showing exact proportions. (B) Transport effect summary quantifies how target lipid binding enhances movement to cholesterol-rich domains, with positive values indicating facilitated transport. (C) Group-level Bayesian analysis shows the population effect with credible intervals, demonstrating statistical significance across multiple proteins.](figures/combined_output.png)

**Figure 1**: Comprehensive analysis output from Lipid Domain Transport Analyzer. **(A) Lipid Transport Effect**: Bar chart showing individual protein transport effects calculated as P(TARGET_D → TARGET_CS) - P(Non_TARGET_D → Non_TARGET_CS). Positive values indicate that DPG3 (target lipid) binding enhances protein transport to cholesterol-rich domains. All four proteins (PROA, PROB, PROC, PROD) show positive transport effects ranging from ~0.23 to 0.51. **(B) Group-Level DPG3 Transport Effect Analysis**: Hierarchical Bayesian posterior distribution of the population-level transport effect. The density plot shows a mean effect of 0.290 with 95% highest density interval [0.064, 0.491], indicating statistically significant transport enhancement. The distribution being entirely positive confirms that DPG3 binding reliably increases protein transport to cholesterol-rich membrane domains. **(C) Protein State Distribution**: Stacked bar chart showing the percentage of simulation time each protein spends in four distinct states. Colors represent: red (Non_DPG3_D) - protein without DPG3 in disordered domains; light blue (Non_DPG3_CS) - protein without DPG3 in cholesterol-rich domains; dark blue (DPG3_D) - DPG3-bound protein in disordered domains; green (DPG3_CS) - DPG3-bound protein in cholesterol-rich domains. Percentage labels show the predominant state occupancies, with most proteins spending ~75% of time in Non_DPG3_CS state and ~25% in DPG3_CS state.

# Implementation

The software is implemented in Python 3.8+ and utilizes several key libraries:

- **MDAnalysis** [@michaud-agrawal2011] for trajectory processing
- **PyMC** [@salvatier2016] for Bayesian statistical modeling  
- **NumPy/SciPy** [@harris2020] for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for visualization

The modular architecture separates concerns:

- `config.py`: Configuration management with automatic system detection
- `data_loader.py`: MD trajectory loading and component identification
- `lipid_analysis.py`: Lipid order parameters and domain mapping
- `hmm_analysis.py`: Hidden Markov Model implementation
- `plotting.py`: Publication figure generation
- `analysis_pipeline.py`: Complete workflow coordination

# Usage Example

```

# Validation and Testing

The software has been validated against manual analysis of GM3-mediated protein transport in EGFR systems, demonstrating accurate state classification and transport effect quantification. The Hidden Markov Model approach successfully captures the complex dynamics of protein-lipid-domain interactions that simpler methods miss.

# Impact and Applications

- **Compare effects** across different lipid types and protein systems  
- **Generate publication-ready results** with minimal manual intervention
- **Apply consistent methodology** across membrane biology studies

The software has immediate applications in studying ganglioside function, cholesterol effects on membrane proteins, lipid raft dynamics, and drug-membrane interactions.
